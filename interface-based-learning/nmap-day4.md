<h1 id="full-open-scan-st-">Full Open Scan (sT)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>An sT scan is a type of network scan performed using Nmap, a popular network exploration tool. The sT scan, also known as a full open scan, involves attempting to establish a full TCP connection with the target system&#39;s ports. This scan method sends a TCP SYN packet to the target and waits for a SYN/ACK response, indicating an open port. By analyzing the responses, the sT scan reveals the status of ports, identifying whether they are open, closed, or filtered. However, unlike stealth scans, sT scans are more likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls due to the full TCP connection establishment.</p>

<h1 id="stealth-scan">Stealth Scan</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A stealth scan, also known as a SYN scan, is a network scanning technique used to gather information about open ports on a target system while minimizing the chances of detection. Instead of completing the TCP handshake, a stealth scan sends SYN packets to the target&#39;s ports. By analyzing the responses received, the scanner can determine if a port is open, closed, or filtered. Stealth scans are preferred in situations where stealthiness and evasion of intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls are desired.</p>

<h1 id="sv">Sv</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>An sV scan is a network scanning technique performed using Nmap, a versatile network exploration tool. The sV scan focuses on service version detection by interrogating the target system&#39;s open ports. It aims to identify the specific services running on those ports and gather information about their versions. By analyzing the responses received from the target, the sV scan provides insights into the software and versions used by the services, aiding in further analysis and potential vulnerability assessment. This scan is particularly useful for understanding the network landscape and identifying potential security risks associated with outdated or vulnerable service versions.</p>
